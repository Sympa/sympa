[%|loc(list.name,conf.sympa,list.host)%]The following message was sent to list '%1' and it seems to contain
one or more commands like subscribe, unsubscribe, help, index, get, ...

If your message contained a command, please notice that

If your message was really meant to be sent to the list, it was
interpreted by the software as a command. Please contact the list owner:  
%1-request@%3 so that he can take care of your message.

Thank you for your attention.
